## Evolutionary library (No longer maintained)

Some evolutionary algorithms written in C++:
 - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
 - Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA)
 - Artificial Immune System (AIS)
 - Feed forward Neural Networks with Backpropagation Learning (NN BP)
 - Recurrent Neural Networks with Backpropagation Through Time learning method (rNN BPTT)

Source code is in src and there are two examples under examples directory:
 - nn contains a main file to run the algorithms of the neural networks and an example of data files
 - tsp contains an example of the travel salesman problem (TSP) solved with  AIS and GA with
 different crossovers and mutation operators.

This code was used for some papers:
